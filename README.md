# ArduinoMIDIRhytmSectionSequencer
MIDI Rhythm Section Sequencer for Arduino DUE

A full description of the project, how to DIY and detailed operating instructions are describred at https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-MIDI-Rhythm-Section-Sequencer/

Please notice that I update the code more or less regularly. I do not compile a log file to keep track of changes (I know I know...) but I update the date in the code when I commit changes. So, if you want your project code kept updated, compare the data of your firmware with the one on github.
